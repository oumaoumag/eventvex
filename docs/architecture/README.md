## 🎯 Overview

EventVex is built as a decentralized, mobile-first event ticketing platform that combines blockchain technology with modern web development practices. The architecture prioritizes security, scalability, and user experience while maintaining decentralization principles.

### Core Principles

- **Decentralization First** - Smart contracts handle core business logic
- **Mobile-Optimized** - Touch-first UI with gasless transactions
- **Social Integration** - Native Farcaster Frame support
- **Developer Experience** - Comprehensive tooling and documentation
- **Security by Design** - Multi-layered security approach

## 🔄 Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Factory Pattern** (Smart Contracts)
- **EventFactory** creates individual **EventTicket** contracts
- Enables isolated event management and upgradability
- Reduces gas costs through contract reuse

### 2. **Component-Based Architecture** (Frontend)
- Modular React components with clear separation of concerns
- Reusable UI components with consistent design system
- State management through Context API and custom hooks

### 3. **Microservice Pattern** (Infrastructure)
- Separate services for different concerns (payments, analytics, social)
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Clear API boundaries between services

### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture** (Blockchain)
- Smart contract events drive frontend state updates
- Real-time notifications through event listeners
- Audit trail through blockchain event logs

## 📊 Data Flow

### Ticket Purchase Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant W as Wallet
    participant P as Paymaster
    participant C as Smart Contract
    participant B as Base Blockchain
    
    U->>F: Select event & seat
    F->>W: Request wallet connection
    W->>F: Provide wallet address
    F->>P: Request gasless transaction
    P->>C: Execute mintTicket()
    C->>B: Record transaction
    B->>C: Emit TicketMinted event
    C->>F: Return ticket NFT
    F->>U: Display ticket confirmation
```

### Event Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Organizer
    participant F as Frontend
    participant W as Wallet
    participant FC as EventFactory
    participant EC as EventTicket
    participant B as Base Blockchain
    
    O->>F: Create event form
    F->>W: Request transaction signature
    W->>FC: Call createEvent()
    FC->>EC: Deploy new EventTicket contract
    EC->>B: Contract deployed
    B->>FC: Return contract address
    FC->>F: Emit EventCreated event
    F->>O: Show event dashboard
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### **Smart Contract Scalability**

1. **Factory Pattern Implementation**
   - Individual contracts per event reduce gas costs
   - Parallel processing of multiple events
   - Isolated failure domains

2. **Gas Optimization**
   - Efficient data structures and algorithms
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Layer 2 scaling through Base network

3. **Upgrade Strategy**
   - Non-upgradeable contracts for security
   - New versions through factory deployment
   - Migration tools for data portability

### **Frontend Scalability**

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Image optimization and CDN usage
   - Caching strategies for blockchain data

2. **State Management**
   - Efficient state updates and re-renders
   - Local storage for user preferences
   - Optimistic UI updates

3. **Mobile Performance**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - Offline functionality for ticket viewing
   - Touch-optimized interactions

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### **Multi-Layer Security Approach**

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - OpenZeppelin battle-tested libraries
   - Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
   - Access control and role management
   - Reentrancy protection and pause mechanisms

2. **Frontend Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure wallet connection handling
   - XSS and CSRF protection
   - Environment variable security

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Private key management best practices
   - Multi-signature wallet for admin functions
   - Regular security audits and updates
   - Monitoring and alerting systems

### **Risk Mitigation**

| Risk Category | Mitigation Strategy | Implementation |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Smart Contract Bugs** | Extensive testing + audits | 95%+ test coverage, OpenZeppelin libs |
| **Private Key Compromise** | Hardware wallets + multisig | Production deployment requirements |
| **Frontend Attacks** | Input validation + CSP | Comprehensive validation layer |
| **Network Issues** | Retry logic + fallbacks | Multiple RPC providers |
| **Gas Price Volatility** | Gasless transactions | Paymaster integration |
